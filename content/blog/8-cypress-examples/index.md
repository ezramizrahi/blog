description: "Examples on how to test a simple SPA with Cypress"

I've created an SPA that includes a few E2E tests using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). The application let's you search for a number of predefined films and directors (see the `films.js` file). The Cypress tests (see the `cypress/integration/` directory) are straightforward and should hopefully demonstrate a simple E2E testing flow. [Have a look at the project over on GitHub](https://github.com/ezramizrahi/cypress_test_examples).
