Timing (I'm still thinking of a better name) is a tool I made that creates a json file of [PerformanceEntry](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/getEntriesByType) objects for a given url. It's built with [Node](https://github.com/nodejs/node), [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer), and [Ora](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ora).

[Have a look at the code over at GitHub](https://github.com/ezramizrahi/timing) and give it a try.
